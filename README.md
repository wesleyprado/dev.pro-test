## Task 1: Logger

Context: Your team is working on a project where you need to log various events and errors.
You are asked to create a simple logging function that writes messages to a text file with a timestamp.

Example usage:
```
log_message("application.log", "User logged in", "INFO")
log_message("application.log", "Failed login attempt", "WARNING")

Expected Output in application.log:
[2023-04-24 12:34:56] [INFO] User logged in
[2023-04-24 12:35:10] [WARNING] Failed login attempt
```

Task 1.1: Tests
Write tests scenarios for Logger


## Task 2: Inventory Management

Context: You are developing a simple inventory management system for a small store.
You need to create a function that takes a list of products with their names, prices, and stock levels, and returns a sorted list of products based on a given sort key (name, price, or stock) and order (ascending or descending).

Example Input:
```
products = [
{"name": "Product A", "price": 100, "stock": 5},
{"name": "Product B", "price": 200, "stock": 3},
{"name": "Product C", "price": 50, "stock": 10}
]
sort_key = "price"
ascending = False

Expected Output:
[
{"name": "Product B", "price": 200, "stock": 3},
{"name": "Product A", "price": 100, "stock": 5},
{"name": "Product C", "price": 50, "stock": 10}
]
```
